## üîß Customization

Each version requires adjustment for your specific setup:

### Main & Laptop Versions:
- Edit the script to update the `imagePath` variable to point to your button image
- If clicks are off-center, adjust the offset values (x+36, y+12)
- For different click timings, modify the `interval` variable (default: 8 seconds)

### Firefox Version:
- Uses a different clicking mechanism (PostMessage instead of mouse movement)
- May require updating window title variable for your Firefox window

## üõ† Troubleshooting

If the script isn't working:

1. Use the "Test Image Search" button to verify button detection
2. Check that Discord is running and visible
3. Ensure the button image is properly captured and saved
4. Try adjusting the variation parameter in ImageSearch (e.g., `*30` to `*50`)
5. Update hardcoded coordinates for your screen resolution

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Limitations

- The script uses fixed coordinates for some actions, so it's tied to your screen resolution
- Different Discord themes or zoom levels require different button images
- Each user setup (resolution, zoom) needs custom configuration
